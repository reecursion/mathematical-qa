Predicted: First find the total time Steve spends writing each letter: 20 minutes / letter * 3 days = 120 minutes / day. Then find the total time Steve spends writing each letter: 20 minutes / letter * 3 days = 120 minutes / day. Then find the total time Steve spends writing each letter: 120 minutes / day * 3 days = 480 minutes / day. Then find the total time Steve spends writing each letter: 480 minutes / day * 3 days = 480 minutes / day. Then find the total time Steve spends writing each letter: 480 minutes / day * 3 days = 480 minutes / day. Then find the total
