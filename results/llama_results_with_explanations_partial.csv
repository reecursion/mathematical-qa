Ben purchased a secondhand bicycle for $\$15$. It was one-fifth of its original price. What was the original price in dollars?",$\boxed{75}$,"Let's denote the original price of the bicycle as x.

Since Ben purchased the bicycle for $\$15$ and it was one-fifth of its original price, we can set up the equation:

15 = (1/5)x

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 5:

5 × 15 = x
75 = x

The answer is: $\boxed{75}$"
1,"If the total of an everlasting geometric sequence is 15 and the sum of the terms squared equals 45, what is the initial term of the sequence?","Let's call the initial term of the geometric sequence $a$ and the common ratio $r$. We are given that the sum of the sequence is 15, so we can write the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

$$S = \frac{a}{1-r}$$

We are also given that the sum of the terms squared is 45. In an infinite geometric series, the sum of the squares of the terms can be expressed as:

$$S^2 = \frac{a^2}{1-r^2}$$

We can substitute the given values into these equations:

$$15 = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
$$45 = \frac{a^2}{1-r^2}$$

From the first equation, we can solve for $a$:

$$a = 15(1-r)$$

Substituting this into the second equation:

$$45 = \frac{(15(1-r))^2}{1-r^2}$$

Now we can simplify and solve for $r$. First, expand and simplify the numerator:

$$45 = \frac{225(1-2r+r^2)}{(1-r^2)}$$

Next, expand the denominator:

$$45(1-r^2) = 225(1-2r+r^2)$$

Expand and rearrange terms:

$$45 - 45r^2 = 225 - 450r + 225r^2$$

Combine like terms:

$$270r^2 - 450r + 180 = 0$$

Divide by 90 to simplify:

$$3r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0$$

We can factor this quadratic equation:

$$(3r-2)(r-1) = 0$$

This gives us two possible solutions for $r$:

$$r = \frac{2}{3}, \quad r = 1$$

However, for a geometric sequence to have a finite sum, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. Therefore, $r = \frac{2}{3}$ is the valid solution.

Now we can substitute the value of $r$ into the equation for $a$ to find the initial term:

$$a = 15(1-r) = 15\left(1-\frac{2}{3}\right) = 15\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \boxed{5}$$ The answer is: 5","Please solve the following problem and give a concise explanation with the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". If the total of an everlasting geometric sequence is 15 and the sum of the terms squared equals 45, what is the initial term of the sequence?",20,"To solve this problem, we need to use the formulas for the sum of an infinite geometric series and the sum of the squares of the terms in the series.

Let's denote the initial term of the sequence as ""a"" and the common ratio as ""r"". The sum of an infinite geometric series is given by:

S = a / (1 - r)

We are given that the sum of the series is 15, so we can write:

15 = a / (1 - r)

We are also given that the sum of the squares of the terms in the series is 45. The sum of the squares of the terms in a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:

S² = a² / (1 - r²)

We are given that S² = 45, so we can write:

45 = a² / (1 - r²)

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for ""a"" and ""r"" by manipulating these equations.

First, let's rewrite the first equation as:

a = 15(1 - r)

Now, substitute this expression for ""a"" into the second equation:

45 = [15(1 - r)]² / (1 - r²)

Simplify the equation:

45 = 225(1 - r)² / (1 - r²)

Cross-multiply and simplify:

45(1 - r²) = 225(1 - r)²

Expand and simplify:

45 - 45r² = 225 - 450r + 225r²

Combine like terms:

270r² - 450r - 180 = 0

Divide by 90:

3r² - 5r - 2 = 0

Factor the quadratic equation:

(3r + 1)(r - 2) = 0

Solve for ""r"":

r = -1/3 or r = 2

Since the sum of the series is 15, the common ratio ""r"" must be less than 1. Therefore, we can discard the solution r = 2.

Now, substitute r = -1/3 into the equation a = 15(1 - r):

a = 15(1 - (-1/3))
a = 15(4/3)
a = 20

The original price of the art piece is $4000.

In three years, the price will triple, so the new price will be 3 times the original price:
New price = 3 × $4000 = $12,000

To find the increase in price, we subtract the original price from the new price:
Increase in price = New price - Original price

3,"The journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles and is divided into x equal portions. Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour. After traveling for 0.7 hours, how many portions of the journey has he covered?
If we know the answer to the above question is 4, what is the value of unknown variable x?","The total distance of the journey is 35 miles.
The journey is divided into x equal portions, so each portion is 35 / x miles.
Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour, which means he covers 40 * 0.7 = 28 miles in 0.7 hours.
To find out how many portions Abel has covered, we divide the distance he has traveled by the distance of each portion: 28 / (35 / x) = 28x / 35.
We are given that Abel has covered 4 portions, so we can write: 28x / 35 = 4.
Solving for x, we get: x = 5.

After traveling for 0.7 hours, how many portions of the journey has he covered?
If we know the answer to the above question is 4, what is the value of unknown variable x?",,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Abel travels at a speed of 40 miles per hour.
2. He travels for 0.7 hours, so the distance he covers is 40 x 0.7 = 28 miles.
3. The total distance from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles, which is divided into x equal portions.
4. Since Abel has covered 28 miles in 0.7 hours, we can set up a proportion to find the number of portions he has covered:

28 miles / 35 miles = 0.7 hours / (x/4) hours (since he has covered 4 portions)

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

28/35 = 0.7 / (x/4)

Cross-multiplying, we get:

28(x/4) = 35(0.7)

Simplifying further, we get:

7x = 24.5

Dividing both sides by 7, we get:

x = 3.5

However, we are told that Abel has covered 4 portions of the journey. Therefore, we can set up a new proportion:

28 miles / 35 miles = 0.7 hours / (x/4) hours

Since Abel has covered 4 portions, we can substitute x/4 = 4 into the proportion:

28 miles / 35 miles = 0.7 hours / 4 hours

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

28/35 = 0.7/4

Cross-multiplying, we get:

28(4) = 35(0.7)

Simplifying further, we get:

112 = 24.5

However, this is not correct. We know that Abel has covered 4 portions, so we can try a different approach.

Since Abel has covered 4 portions, the distance he has covered is 4(x/4) = x miles. We know that this distance is equal to 28 miles, so we can set up an equation:

x = 28

However, this is not correct. We know that the total distance is 35 miles, and we want to find the value of x. Since Abel has covered 4 portions, the distance he has covered is 4(x/4) = x miles. We know that this distance is equal to 28 miles, but we also know that the total distance is 35 miles. Therefore, the remaining distance"

5,"Maria needs to calculate the circumference and the area of a circular garden to determine the amount of fencing and grass seed she needs to buy. The actual diameter of the garden is 20 cm, but Maria's measurement could be off by up to $20\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden?","To find the largest possible percent error in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden, we need to consider both the largest possible overestimate and the largest possible underestimate in her measurements.

Let's first consider the circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = \pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter. Since Maria's measurement could be off by up to $20\%$, the largest possible overestimate would be if she measured the diameter to be $20 + 20\%$ and the largest possible underestimate would be if she measured the diameter to be $20 - 20\%$. 

For the largest possible overestimate, the diameter measured by Maria would be $20 + 0.2 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm. Using this diameter, the calculated circumference would be $C_o = \pi \times 24$ cm.

For the largest possible underestimate, the diameter measured by Maria would be $20 - 0.2 \times 20 = 20 - 4 = 16$ cm. Using this diameter, the calculated circumference would be $C_u = \pi \times 16$ cm.

Now, let's consider the area. The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. The radius is equal to half the diameter, so for the largest possible overestimate, the radius measured by Maria would be $(24/2)$ cm, and for the largest possible underestimate, the radius measured by Maria would be $(16/2)$ cm.

For the largest possible overestimate, the calculated area would be $A_o = \pi \left(\frac{24}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

For the largest possible underestimate, the calculated area would be $A_u = \pi \left(\frac{16}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

To find the largest possible percent error in the computed circumference and area, we will compare the difference between the actual values and the computed values, and express it as a percentage of the actual values.

The actual circumference of the garden is $C_a = \pi \times 20$ cm, and the actual area is $A_a = \pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

The largest possible percent error in the computed circumference is given by:

$\left|\frac{C_a - C_o}{C_a}\right| \times 100\%$

The largest possible percent error in the computed area is given by:

$\left|\frac{A_a - A_o}{A_a}\right| \times 100\%$

We can calculate these values now:

$\left|\frac{C_a - C_o}{C_a}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\pi \times 20 - \pi \times 24}{\pi \times 20}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{20-24}{20}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{-4}{20}\right| \times 100\% = 20\%$

$\left|\frac{A_a - A_o}{A_a}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 - \pi \left(\frac{24}{2}\right)^2}{\pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\frac{20^2 - 24^2}{2^2}}{\frac{20^2}{2^2}}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\frac{400 - 576}{4}}{\frac{400}{4}}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{-176}{400}\right| \times 100\% = 44\%$

Therefore, the largest possible percent error in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden is $\boxed{20\%}$ for the circumference and $\boxed{44\%}$ for the area. The answer is: 44","Please solve the following problem and give a concise explanation with the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". Maria needs to calculate the circumference and the area of a circular garden to determine the amount of fencing and grass seed she needs to buy.

## Step 2:  The formula for percent error is given by $\frac{|x - y|}{|x|} \times 100\%$, where $x$ is the actual value and $y$ is the measured or calculated value.
## Step 3:  In this scenario, Maria's measurement of the diameter could be off by up to $20\%$, so we need to consider the largest possible error in her measurement.
## Step 4:  The actual diameter of the garden is $20$ cm, and Maria's measurement could be up to $20\%$ off, which means the largest possible diameter she could measure is $20 + (20\% \text{ of } 20) = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm.
## Step 5:  We then need to calculate the circumference and area of the garden using both the actual diameter and Maria's largest possible measurement.
## Step 6:  The formula for the circumference of a circle is $2\pi r$, and the formula for the area is $\pi r^2$.
## Step 7:  For the actual diameter of $20$ cm, the circumference is $2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi$ cm, and the area is $\pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi$ square cm.
## Step 8:  For Maria's largest possible measurement of $24$ cm, the circumference is $2\pi \times 12 = 24\pi$ cm, and the area is $\pi \times 12^2 = 144\pi$ square cm.
## Step 9:  Now, we can calculate the percent error in Maria's computed circumference and area by using the formula for percent error.
## Step 10:  For the circumference, the percent error is $\frac{|20\pi - 24\pi|}{20\pi} \times 100\% = \frac{4\pi}{20\pi} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{5} \times 100\% = 20\%$.
## Step 11:  For the area, the percent error is $\frac{|100\pi - 144\pi|}{100\pi}"

Since the two given points are adjacent points on the square, the distance between them will give us the length of one side of the square.

Let's call the two points $A(2, 1)$ and $B(3, 4)$. To find the distance between them, we use the distance formula between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the Cartesian plane, which is given by:

To solve for $X$, we can cross-multiply:
$2\sqrt{13} = 3X$
Dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find:
$X = \frac{2\sqrt{13}}{3}$
The value of X is $\frac{2\sqrt{13}}{3}$.

If we know the answer to the above question is \frac{2}{3}, what is the value of unknown variable X?",,"## Step 1:  We are given a right-angled triangle $VWX$ where $VX = \sqrt{13}$ and $VW = X$. We need to find the value of $\tan V$.
## Step 2:  To find $\tan V$, we can use the definition of tangent in a right-angled triangle, which is the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle.
## Step 3:  From the given information, we know that $VW = 3$ and $VX = \sqrt{13}$.
## Step 4:  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side $WX$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
## Step 5:  Therefore, $WX = \sqrt{VX^2 - VW^2} = \sqrt{13 - 9} = \sqrt{4} = 2$.
## Step 6:  Now that we have the lengths of the sides $VW$ and $WX$, we can find $\tan V$ using the definition of tangent.

First, we need to evaluate the summation $\sum_{k=0}^{50} (-1)^k (k+1)$. This is an alternating series where each term is the product of $(-1)^k$ and $k+1$. We can rewrite the series as $\sum_{k=0}^{50} (-1)^k (k+1) = 1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + \cdots + 50 + (-1)^{50} 51$.

## Step 2: Simplify the alternating series
We can pair the terms of the series to simplify it. The pairs are $(1-3) + (2-4) + (5-7) + \cdots + (49-51)$. Each pair sums to $-2$, and there are $25$ pairs.

## Step 3: Calculate the sum of the pairs
The sum of the pairs is $-2 \times 25 = -50$. We also need to add the last term, which is $(-1)^{50} 51 = 51$. Therefore, the sum of the series is $-50 + 51 = 1$.

## Step 4: Evaluate the binomial coefficients
Next, we need to evaluate the binomial coefficients $\binom{99}{2k}$. We can use the property of binomial coefficients that $\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}$. Therefore, $\binom{99}{2k} = \binom{99}{99-2k}$.

## Step 5: Simplify the binomial coefficients
We can simplify the binomial coefficients by using the property that $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$. Therefore, $\binom{99}{2k} = \frac{99!}{(2k)!(99-2k)!}$.

## Step 6: Calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients
The sum of the binomial coefficients is $\sum_{k=0}^{50} \binom{99}{2k}$. We can use the property of binomial coefficients that $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n$. Therefore, $\sum_{k=0}^{50} \binom{99}{2"

14,Find out how many positive integers $n$ exist such that the total of the integers from 1 to $n$ divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder.,"Let's denote the desired sum as $S_n$. We are looking for positive integers $n$ such that $S_n$ divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder. 

The sum of the integers from 1 to $n$ can be expressed as:
\[
S_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + (n-1) + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

So, we need to find positive integers $n$ for which $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ divides $6n$ without a remainder. 

To simplify our analysis, let's divide both the numerator and the denominator of $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $n$ and $n+1$. Let gcd($n$, $n+1$) = $d$. Then we can write $n=a \cdot d$ and $n+1=b \cdot d$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers. Notice that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime since gcd($n$, $n+1$) accounts for all the common factors. 

Substituting these expressions in $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$, we get:
\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{a \cdot d \cdot b \cdot d}{2} = ab \cdot \frac{d^2}{2}
\]

Therefore, $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is divisible by $d^2$, and $\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = m \cdot d^2$ for some positive integer $m$.

Now, we know that $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ also divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder. So, we have:
\[
\frac{6n}{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}} = \frac{12n}{n(n+1)} = \frac{12}{n+1} = k
\]
where $k$ is a positive integer.

This implies that $(n+1)$ divides $12$. Since we are looking for positive integers $n$, we can limit our analysis to the divisors of $12$ (excluding $1$):

\[
\begin{align*}
(n+1) & = 2 \Rightarrow n=1\\
(n+1) & = 3 \Rightarrow n=2\\
(n+1) & = 4 \Rightarrow n=3\\
(n+1) & = 6 \Rightarrow n=5\\
(n+1) & = 12 \Rightarrow n=11\\
\end{align*}
\]

Thus, there are $\boxed{5}$ positive integers $n$ for which the total of the integers from 1 to $n$ divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder. The answer is: 5","Please solve the following problem and give a concise explanation with the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". Find out how many positive integers $n$ exist such that the total of the integers from 1 to $n$ divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder.",,"## Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the number of positive integers $n$ such that the sum of the integers from 1 to $n$ (which is given by the formula $n(n+1)/2$) divides $6n$ without leaving a remainder.

## Step 2: Express the condition mathematically
The condition can be expressed as $n(n+1)/2$ dividing $6n$. This can be written as $n(n+1)/2 | 6n$.

## Step 3: Simplify the condition
We can simplify the condition by multiplying both sides by $2$ to get $n(n+1) | 12n$.

## Step 4: Further simplify the condition
Since $n(n+1)$ is a product of two consecutive integers, it is even. Therefore, $n(n+1) | 12n$ is equivalent to $n(n+1) | 6n$.

## Step 5: Analyze the divisibility condition
For $n(n+1)$ to divide $6n$, we need to consider the factors of $6n$ and how they relate to $n(n+1)$. Since $6n$ has a factor of $6$, which is a multiple of $3$, we need to examine the divisibility by $3$.

## Step 6: Examine divisibility by 3
For $n(n+1)$ to be divisible by $3$, either $n$ or $n+1$ must be divisible by $3$. This implies that $n$ must be congruent to either $0$ or $2$ modulo $3$.

## Step 7: Count the number of possible values of n
We need to count the number of positive integers $n$ that satisfy the condition. Since $n$ must be congruent to either $0$ or $2$ modulo $3$, we can count the number of integers in each case.

## Step 8: Count the number of integers congruent to 0 modulo 3
The integers congruent to $0$ modulo $3$ are $3, 6, 9, ...$. We can count the number of such integers by finding the number of terms in the sequence.

## Step 9: Count the number of integers congruent to 2 modulo 3
The integers congruent to $2$ modulo $3$ are $2, "

Since Theresa can spend $1000, each volume costs $1000/x.

Since Maria can spend $200 more than Theresa, she can spend $1000 + $200 = $1200. Therefore, the number of hardcover volumes Maria can buy is $1200 / ($1000/x) = (1200 * x) / 1000 = 1.2x.

Since Maria can buy 1.2x volumes, we need to find the smallest integer value of x such that 1.2x is an integer. This is because Maria cannot buy a fraction of a volume.

The smallest integer value of x such that 1.2x is an integer is x = 5, because 1.2 * 5 = 6, which is an integer.

Therefore, Maria can buy 6 hardcover volumes.

Total number of possible outcomes: There are 6 faces on the cube, so each face has an equal chance of being the top face. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 6.

Number of favorable outcomes: Since there are 4 blue faces and 2 red faces, there are 4 blue faces that could be the top face. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 4.

Probability of the top face being blue: We can now calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes:
