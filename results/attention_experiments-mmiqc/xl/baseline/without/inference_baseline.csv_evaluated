What was the original price in dollars?,"Please solve the following problem and only output the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". Ben purchased a secondhand bicycle for $\$15$. It was one-fifth of its original price. What was the original price in dollars?","We must find the number that makes the equation  \[? \times \dfrac{1}{5} = 15\] valid. Dividing $15$ by $\dfrac{1}{5}$, we arrive at $15 \div \dfrac{1}{5} = \dfrac{15}{1} \times \dfrac{5}{1} = 15 \times 5 = 75$.

1,"If the total of an everlasting geometric sequence is 15 and the sum of the terms squared equals 45, what is the initial term of the sequence?","Please solve the following problem and only output the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". If the total of an everlasting geometric sequence is 15 and the sum of the terms squared equals 45, what is the initial term of the sequence?","Let's call the initial term of the geometric sequence $a$ and the common ratio $r$. We are given that the sum of the sequence is 15, so we can write the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

$$S = \frac{a}{1-r}$$

We are also given that the sum of the terms squared is 45. In an infinite geometric series, the sum of the squares of the terms can be expressed as:

$$S^2 = \frac{a^2}{1-r^2}$$

We can substitute the given values into these equations:

$$15 = \frac{a}{1-r}$$
$$45 = \frac{a^2}{1-r^2}$$

From the first equation, we can solve for $a$:

$$a = 15(1-r)$$

Substituting this into the second equation:

$$45 = \frac{(15(1-r))^2}{1-r^2}$$

Now we can simplify and solve for $r$. First, expand and simplify the numerator:

$$45 = \frac{225(1-2r+r^2)}{(1-r^2)}$$

Next, expand the denominator:

$$45(1-r^2) = 225(1-2r+r^2)$$

Expand and rearrange terms:

$$45 - 45r^2 = 225 - 450r + 225r^2$$

Combine like terms:

$$270r^2 - 450r + 180 = 0$$

Divide by 90 to simplify:

$$3r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0$$

We can factor this quadratic equation:

$$(3r-2)(r-1) = 0$$

This gives us two possible solutions for $r$:

$$r = \frac{2}{3}, \quad r = 1$$

However, for a geometric sequence to have a finite sum, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. Therefore, $r = \frac{2}{3}$ is the valid solution.

Now we can substitute the value of $r$ into the equation for $a$ to find the initial term:

$$a = 15(1-r) = 15\left(1-\frac{2}{3}\right) = 15\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \boxed{5}$$ The answer is: 5",5,5,,word_problem,False,"assistant<|end_header_id|>

The journey is divided into x equal portions, so each portion is 35 / x miles.
Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour, which means he covers 40 * 0.7 = 28 miles in 0.7 hours.
To find out how many portions Abel has covered, we divide the distance he has traveled by the distance of each portion: 28 / (35 / x) = 28x / 35.

5,"Maria needs to calculate the circumference and the area of a circular garden to determine the amount of fencing and grass seed she needs to buy. The actual diameter of the garden is 20 cm, but Maria's measurement could be off by up to $20\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden?","Please solve the following problem and only output the answer at the end with ""The answer is: "". Maria needs to calculate the circumference and the area of a circular garden to determine the amount of fencing and grass seed she needs to buy. The actual diameter of the garden is 20 cm, but Maria's measurement could be off by up to $20\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden?","To find the largest possible percent error in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden, we need to consider both the largest possible overestimate and the largest possible underestimate in her measurements.

Let's first consider the circumference. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = \pi d$, where $d$ is the diameter. Since Maria's measurement could be off by up to $20\%$, the largest possible overestimate would be if she measured the diameter to be $20 + 20\%$ and the largest possible underestimate would be if she measured the diameter to be $20 - 20\%$. 

For the largest possible overestimate, the diameter measured by Maria would be $20 + 0.2 \times 20 = 20 + 4 = 24$ cm. Using this diameter, the calculated circumference would be $C_o = \pi \times 24$ cm.

For the largest possible underestimate, the diameter measured by Maria would be $20 - 0.2 \times 20 = 20 - 4 = 16$ cm. Using this diameter, the calculated circumference would be $C_u = \pi \times 16$ cm.

Now, let's consider the area. The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius. The radius is equal to half the diameter, so for the largest possible overestimate, the radius measured by Maria would be $(24/2)$ cm, and for the largest possible underestimate, the radius measured by Maria would be $(16/2)$ cm.

For the largest possible overestimate, the calculated area would be $A_o = \pi \left(\frac{24}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

For the largest possible underestimate, the calculated area would be $A_u = \pi \left(\frac{16}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

To find the largest possible percent error in the computed circumference and area, we will compare the difference between the actual values and the computed values, and express it as a percentage of the actual values.

The actual circumference of the garden is $C_a = \pi \times 20$ cm, and the actual area is $A_a = \pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2$ cm$^2$.

The largest possible percent error in the computed circumference is given by:

$\left|\frac{C_a - C_o}{C_a}\right| \times 100\%$

The largest possible percent error in the computed area is given by:

$\left|\frac{A_a - A_o}{A_a}\right| \times 100\%$

We can calculate these values now:

$\left|\frac{C_a - C_o}{C_a}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\pi \times 20 - \pi \times 24}{\pi \times 20}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{20-24}{20}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{-4}{20}\right| \times 100\% = 20\%$

$\left|\frac{A_a - A_o}{A_a}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2 - \pi \left(\frac{24}{2}\right)^2}{\pi \left(\frac{20}{2}\right)^2}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\frac{20^2 - 24^2}{2^2}}{\frac{20^2}{2^2}}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{\frac{400 - 576}{4}}{\frac{400}{4}}\right| \times 100\% = \left|\frac{-176}{400}\right| \times 100\% = 44\%$

Therefore, the largest possible percent error in Maria's computed circumference and area of the garden is $\boxed{20\%}$ for the circumference and $\boxed{44\%}$ for the area. The answer is: 44",44,20%,,word_problem,False,"assistant<|end_header_id|>

If we know the answer to the above question is 26, what is the value of unknown variable X?","We are given the equation:
$\frac{2x + X}{5} = 11$
To find the value of $x$, we can solve this equation.
We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
$2x + X = 55$
Now, we can combine like terms by subtracting X from both sides of the equation:
$2x = 55 - X$
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find:
$x = \frac{55 - X}{2}$
Given that the value of $x$ is 26, we can substitute it into the equation:
$26 = \frac{55 - X}{2}$
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
$52 = 55 - X$
Subtracting 55 from both sides of the equation, we find:
$-3 = -X$
Dividing both sides of the equation by -1, we get:
$X = 3$
The value of X is 3.

9,"On a Cartesian coordinate plane, points $(2,1)$ and $(3, 4)$ are adjacent points on a square.

On a Cartesian coordinate plane, points $(2,1)$ and $(3, 4)$ are adjacent points on a square. What is the area of the square?","To find the area of the square, we need to determine the length of its side. Since the two given points are adjacent points on the square, the distance between them will give us the length of one side of the square.

Let's call the two points $A(2, 1)$ and $B(3, 4)$. To find the distance between them, we use the distance formula between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ in the Cartesian plane, which is given by:

\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

For points $A(2, 1)$ and $B(3, 4)$:

\[ d = \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (4 - 1)^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{1 + 9} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{10} \]

This distance represents the length of one side of the square. Now, the area of a square is given by the square of the length of its side:

\[ \text{Area} = (\text{Side Length})^2 \]

Thus, the area of the square is:

\[ \text{Area} = (\sqrt{10})^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 10 \]

Therefore, the area of the square is $\boxed{10}$ square units. The answer is: 10",10,2,,equation,False,"assistant<|end_header_id|>
